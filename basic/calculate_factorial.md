# Calculate Factorial

**Problem:**

Write a Python function `calculate_factorial(n)` to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer `n` using recursion.

**Example:**

```
calculate_factorial(5) -> 120
calculate_factorial(0) -> 1
calculate_factorial(3) -> 6
```

**Constraints:**

- The input integer `n` will be non-negative.

**Instructions to candidates:**

- You are required to write a Python function `calculate_factorial(n)` which takes a single non-negative integer `n` as input and returns its factorial.
- You are not allowed to use any built-in functions for calculating factorial. Your implementation should use recursion to solve the problem.

**Note to the Interviewer:**

This problem tests the candidate's understanding of recursion and the ability to implement a simple mathematical algorithm using recursion. It also assesses their knowledge of basic Python syntax and programming concepts.
