# Calculate Area

## Problem Question

Write a Python function called calculate_area that calculates the area of different geometric shapes. The function should take two arguments: shape (a string indicating the type of shape) and params (a list containing the necessary parameters for calculating the area).

The function should support the following shapes:

- Circle: Requires one parameter, the radius.
- Rectangle: Requires two parameters, the length and width.
- Triangle: Requires two parameters, the base and height.
- Square: Requires one parameter, the length of a side.
The function should return the calculated area.

Write another function called print_shapes_areas that takes a list of shapes and their corresponding parameters as input, and prints each shape along with its calculated area.
